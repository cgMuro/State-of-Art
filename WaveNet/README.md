**WaveNet** is a probabilistic, autoregressive, deep learning model by DeepMind for generating raw audio waveforms.

It can be used for multi-speaker speech generation, text-to-speech tasks, generating novel music, and discriminative audio problems.


## Architecture

### Dilated Causal Convolution

</div>

* It's the combination of causal and dilated convolutions  
* *Causal Convolution* -> a convolutional layer that respects the ordering of the data.
* *Dilated Convolution* -> a convolutional layer where the filter is applied over an area larger than its length by skipping input values with a certain step.

### Gated Activation Units
Applies the TanH and Sigmoid activation functions on the convolutions output and then performs element-wise multiplication over the results of the two functions.

### Residual and Skip Connections
Here's an overview of the entire architecture, along with the residual and skip connections.

To speed up convergence and enable training of deeper models, both residual and parameterized skip connections are used throughout the network.

### Softmax distributions and Mu-law
* Softmax distributions are used to model the conditional distributions over individual audio samples.
* To make the process more tractable, a Âµ-law companding transformation is applied to the data.
